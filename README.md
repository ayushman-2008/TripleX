# TripleX
My First C++ Terminal Game. 

Hey AC here. You might wanna know how this works. Just open this on vs code or something and open the terminal. (make sure its not powershell, it should be cmd). Write triplex on the terminal and ur good to go. then first sentence is a bit messy but it just means u can play the game. The game advances till level 5 which is the last level :D.
